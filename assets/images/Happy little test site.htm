                        <h1>A Happy Accident</h1>
                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.
                        </p>
                        <p class="notation">
                            Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Learn when to stop. Just use the old one inch brush. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll.
                        </p>

                        <h1>There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush</h1>

                            It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?  We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Let your heart be your guide. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.
                        </p>

                            The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Anything you want to do you can do here. Let that brush dance around there and play.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. In your world you have total and absolute power. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. That's crazy. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Isn't that fantastic? You can do it. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.
